## Installation
To install the toolbox first clone the [Github respository](https://github.com/maegant/POLAR){:target="_blank"}

To use POLAR from outside of the folder, first add the POLAR repository to your MATLAB path. 

To initialize the toolbox run the setup function
``
toolbox_setup
``

## New Experiment
To use POLAR for your own environment, you will need to define the required settings, listed in the [new-environment]({{site.baseurl}}/new-environment/) tutorial. 

## Examples
Seven different [example environments]({{site.baseurl}}/examples/) are included in the POLAR toolbox, all of which are included to illustrate various toolbox features.
