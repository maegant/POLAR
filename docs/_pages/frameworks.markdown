# Learning Objectives 
POLAR is capable of two distinct learning objectives: regret minimization and active learning. Regret minimization with preference feedback is sometimes called "Preference Optimization" where the objective is to locate the optimal action as quickly as possible. On the other hand, the goal of active learning is the learn the entire underlying preference landscape.
